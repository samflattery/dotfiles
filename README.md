# dotfiles
My vim, tmux and zsh dotfiles

Requires oh-my-zsh to be installed and the Vundle package manager for vim

Best used with iTerm2 with the solarized colorscheme activated.

For the zsh config to work, make a new file in the dotfiles folder called zshpath and put:
```export ZSH="path/to/.oh-my-zsh"```
in it
